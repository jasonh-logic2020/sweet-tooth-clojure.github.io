<div class="paragraph">
<p>Writing a framework is a foolish endeavor that can be made a little less foolish
by clarifying what makes a good framework. If you&#8217;re going to spend an
inordinate amount of time toiling away in front of a monitor for no tangible
benefit then you might as well try to do a good job of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far I haven&#8217;t found a guide to good framework design (or even a good
explanation of what a framework <em>is</em>!), so here&#8217;s my attempt to fill that void.
A framework framework, if you will. I hope you find it useful. I hope even more
that you&#8217;ve found something more useful and can point me to it. (If that sounds
like a cry for help, that&#8217;s because it is!)</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_what_is_a_framework"><a class="anchor" href="#_what_is_a_framework"></a>What is a Framework?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A framework is a set of libraries that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Manages the complexity of coordinating the <em>resources</em> needed to write an
application&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by providing <em>abstractions</em> for those resources&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and <em>systems for communicating</em> between those resources&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>within an <em>environment</em>&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so that programmers can <em>focus on writing the business logic</em> that&#8217;s specific
to their product</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll elaborate on each of these points using examples from <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and from the
ultimate framework: the <em>operating system</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might wonder, how is an OS a framework? When you look at the list of
framework responsibilities, you&#8217;ll notice that the OS handles all of them, and
it handles them exceedingly well. Briefly: an OS provides virtual abstractions
for hardware resources so that programmers don&#8217;t have to focus on the details
of, say, pushing bytes onto some particular disk or managing CPU scheduling. It
also provides the conventions of a hierarchical filesystem with an addressing
system consisting of names separated by forward slashes, and these conventions
provide one way for resources to communicate with each other (Process A can
write to <code>/foo/bar</code> while Process B reads from it) - if every programmer came up
with her own bespoke addressing system, it would be a disaster. The OS handles
this for us so we can focus on application-specific tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because operating systems are such successful frameworks we&#8217;ll look at a few of
their features in some detail so that we can get a better understanding of what
good framework design looks like.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_coordinating_resources"><a class="anchor" href="#_coordinating_resources"></a>Coordinating Resources</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Resources</em> are the "materials" used by programs to do their work, and can be
divided into four categories: storage, computation, communication, and
interfaces. Examples of storage include files, databases, and caches.
Computation examples include processes, threads, actors, background jobs, and
core.async processes. For communication there are HTTP requests, message queues,
and event buses. Interfaces typically include keyboard and mouse, plus screens
and the systems used to display stuff on them: gui toolkits, browsers and the
DOM, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/resource-categories.jpg" alt="resource categories">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. the four resource categories</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Specialized resources are built on top of more general-purpose resources. (Some
refer to these specialized resources as <em>services</em> or <em>components</em>.) We start
with hardware and build virtual resources on top. With storage, the OS starts
with disks and memory and creates the filesystem as a virtual storage resource
on top. Databases like Postgres use the filesystem to create another virtual
storage resource to handle use cases not met by the filesystem. Datomic uses
other databases like Cassandra or DynamoDB as its storage layer. Browsers create
their own virtual environments and introduce new resources like local storage
and cookies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For computation, the OS introduces processes and threads as virtual resources
representing and organizing program execution. Erlang creates an environment
with a process model that&#8217;s dramatically different from the underlying OS&#8217;s.
Same deal with Clojure&#8217;s <code>core.async</code>, which introduces the <em>communicating
sequential processes</em> computation model. It&#8217;s a virtual model defined by Clojure
macros, "compiled" to core clojure, then compiled to JVM bytecode (or
JavaScript!), which then has to be executed by operating system processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interfaces follow the same pattern: on the visual display side, the OS paints to
monitors, applications paint to their own virtual canvas, browsers are
applications which introduce their own resources (the DOM and <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>), and
React introduces a virtual DOM. Emacs is an operating system on top of the
operating system, and it provides windows and frames.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Resources <em>manage</em> their own <em>entities</em>: in a database, entities could include
tables, rows, triggers, and sequences. Filesystem entities include directories
and files. A GUI manages windows, menu bars, and other components. To manage a
resource is to create, validate, secure, and dispose of resource entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(I realize that this description of <em>resource</em> is not the kind of airtight,
axiomatic, comprehensive description that programmers like. One shortcoming is
that the boundary between resource and application is pretty thin: Postgres is
an application in its own right, but from the perspective of a Rails app it&#8217;s a
resource. Still, hopefully my use of <em>resource</em> is clear enough that you
nevertheless understand what the f I&#8217;m talking about when I talk about
resources.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Coordinating</em> these resources is inherently complex. Hell, coordinating anything
is complex. I still remember the first time I got smacked in the face with a
baseball in little league thanks to a lack of coordination. There was also a
time period where I, as a child, took tae kwon do classes and frequently ended
up sitting with my back against the wall with my eyes closed in pain because a)
my mom for some reason refused to buy me an athletic cup and b) I did not
possess the coordination to otherwise protect myself during sparring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When building a product, you have to decide how to create, validate, secure, and
dispose of resource entities; how to convey entities from one resource to
another; and how to deal with issues like timing (race conditions) and failure
handling that arise whenever resources interact, all without getting hit in the
face. Rails, for instance, was designed to coordinate browsers, HTTP servers,
and databases. It had to convey user input to a database, and also retrieve and
render database records for display by the user interface, via HTTP requests and
responses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no obvious or objectively correct way to coordinate these resources. In
Rails, HTTP requests would get dispatched to a Controller, which was responsible
for interacting with a database and making data available to a View, which would
render HTML that could be sent back to the browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to coordinate web app resources using the Model/View/Controller
(MVC) approach Rails uses, but you do have to coordinate these resources
<em>somehow</em>. These decisions involve making tradeoffs and imposing constraints to
achieve a balance of extensibility (creating a system generic enough for new
resources to participate) and power (allowing the system to fully exploit the
unique features of a specific resource).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a very difficult task even for experienced developers, and the choices
you make could have negative repercussions that aren&#8217;t apparent until you&#8217;re
heavily invested in them. With Rails, for instance, ActiveRecord (AR) provided a
good generic abstraction for databases, but early on it was very easy to produce
extremely inefficient SQL, and sometimes very difficult to produce efficient
SQL. You&#8217;d often have to hand-write SQL, eliminating some of the benefits of
using AR in the first place.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For complete beginners, the task of making these tradeoffs is impossible because
doing so requires experience. Beginners won&#8217;t even know that it&#8217;s necessary to
make these decisions. At the same time, more experienced developers would prefer
to spend their time and energy solving more important problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frameworks make these decisions for us, allowing us to focus on business logic.
The <em>manage</em> resources by by introducing <em>communication systems</em> and
<em>abstractions</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_resource_management"><a class="anchor" href="#_resource_management"></a>Resource Management</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s decompose "resource management" to better understand what exactly
frameworks are responsible for. To start, it&#8217;s useful to break down resource
management into the <em>component level</em> and the <em>entity level</em>. At the component
level, we talk about:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Starting and stopping a database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming a job scheduler</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting and stopping an HTTP server</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, component management is about start, stopping, and sometimes pausing
and resuming a sub-system which itself manages entities. For operating systems,
we have tools like systemd and upstart to handle this. In Clojure apps, we have
<a href="https://github.com/weavejester/integrant">Integrant</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tolitius/mount">mount</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/stuartsierra/component">component</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the entity level, resource management involves task like:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>create / read / update / delete a database record</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>add / pause / remove a background job</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create / wait for / respond to XHR request</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stepping back, we might say that resource management is about changing state and
responding to state changes. "State" is one of those very overloaded programming
terms, so like, don&#8217;t kill me if I use it differently than you. But when talking
about state, I think it&#8217;s important to differentiate between <em>operational state</em>
and <em>content</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Content examples include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The screenplay you&#8217;re writing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The source of the framework you&#8217;re building for some reason</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTTP headers and body</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We perform CRUD operations to change content.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Operational state, on the other hand, is metadata relevant to state change
operations. (Note to self: this definition may need work?) Examples include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whether form input is valid or invalid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether a file is writeable or read-only</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether an operation succeeded or failed</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This distinction has been helpful for me because it&#8217;s helped me be more rigorous
in creating good user experiences. A lot of creating a good user experience is
about providing feedback to the user. But what is feedback? Feedback is
information about the operational state of resource entities, and frameworks
help us manage that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So anyway, we have to manage resources somehow. But how? That&#8217;s where
abstractions come in.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_resource_abstractions"><a class="anchor" href="#_resource_abstractions"></a>Resource Abstractions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our software interacts with resources via their <em>abstractions</em>. I think of
abstractions as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the data structures used to represent a resource</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the set of messages for changing retrieving state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the set of possible operational states</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the mechanisms for responding to operational state changes</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(<em>Abstraction</em> might be a terrible word to use here. Every developer over three
years old has their own definition, and if mine doesn&#8217;t correspond to yours just
cut me a little slack and run with it :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rails exposes a database resource that your application code interacts with via
the <code>ActiveRecord</code> abstraction. Tables correspond to classes, and rows to
objects of that class. This a choice with tradeoffs - rows could have been
represented as Ruby hashes (a primitive akin to a JSON object), which might have
made them more portable while making it more difficult to concisely express
database operations like <code>save</code> and <code>destroy</code>. The abstraction also responds to
<code>find</code>, <code>create</code>, <code>update</code>, and <code>destroy</code>. You respond to operational state
changes via lifecycle callback methods like <code>before/validation</code>. Frameworks add
value by identifying these state transitions and providing interfaces for them
when they&#8217;re absent from the underlying resource.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You already know this, but it bears saying: abstractions let us code at a higher
level. Framework abstractions handle the concerns that are specific to resource
management, letting us focus on building products. Designed well, they enable
loose coupling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nothing exemplifies this better than the massively successful <em>file</em> abstraction
that the UNIX framework introduced. We&#8217;re going to look at in detail because it
embodies design wisdom that can help us understand what makes a good framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The core file functions are <code>open</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and <code>close</code>. Files are
represented as sequential streams of bytes, which is just as much a choice as
ActiveRecord&#8217;s choice to use Ruby objects. Within processes, open files are
represented as <em>file descriptors</em>, which are usually a small integer. The <code>open</code>
function takes a path and returns a file descriptor, and <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, and
<code>close</code> take a file descriptor as an argument to do their work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now here&#8217;s the amazing magical kicker: <em>file</em> doesn&#8217;t have to mean <em>file on
disk</em>. Just as Rails implements the ActiveRecord abstraction for MySQL and
Postgres, the OS implements the file abstraction for <strong>pipes</strong>, terminals, and
other resources, meaning that your programs can write to them using the same
system calls as you&#8217;d use to write files to disk - indeed, from your program&#8217;s
standpoint, all it knows is that it&#8217;s writing to a file; it doesn&#8217;t know that
the "file" that a file descriptor refers to might actually be a pipe.</p>

<div class="admonitionblock note">

Exercise for the reader: write a couple paragraphs explaining precisely
the design choices that enable this degree of loose coupling. How can these

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This design is a huge part of UNIX&#8217;s famed simplicity. It&#8217;s what lets us run
this in a shell:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-bash hljs" data-lang="bash"># list files in the current directory and perform a word count on the output
ls | wc</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The shell interprets this by launching an <code>ls</code> process. Normally, when a process
is launched it creates three file descriptors (which, remember, represent open
files): <code>0</code> for <code>STDIN</code>, <code>1</code> for <code>STDOUT</code>, and <code>2</code> for <code>STDERR</code>, and the shell
sets each file descriptor to refer to your terminal (terminals can be files!!
what!?!?). Your shell sees the pipe, <code>|</code>, and sets <code>ls&#8217;s `STDOUT</code> to the pipe&#8217;s
<code>STDIN</code>, and the pipe&#8217;s <code>STDOUT</code> to <code>wc&#8217;s `STDIN</code>. The pipe links processes'
file descriptors, while the processes get to read and write "files" without
having to know what&#8217;s actually on the other end. No joke, every time I think of
this I get a little excited tingle at the base of my spine because I am a:</p>

<p>This is why file I/O is referred to as <em>the universal I/O model</em>. I&#8217;ll have more
to say about this in the next section, but I share it here to illustrate how
much more powerful your programming environment can be if you find the right
abstractions. The file I/O model still dominates decades after its introduction,
making our lives easier <em>without our even having to understand how it actually
works</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The canonical first exercise any beginner programmer performs is to write a
program that prints out, <em>What up, y&#8217;all?</em>. This program makes use of the file
model, but the beginner doesn&#8217;t have to even know that such a thing exists. This
is what a good framework does. A well-designed framework lets you easily get
started building simple applications, without preventing you building more
complicated and useful ones as you learn more.</p>

<p>One final point about abstractions: they provide mechanisms for calling your
application&#8217;s code. We saw this a bit earlier with ActiveRecord&#8217;s lifecycle
methods. Frameworks will usually provide the overall structure for how an
application should interact with its environment, defining sets of events that
you write custom handlers for. With ActiveRecord lifecycles, the structure of
<code>before/create</code>, <code>create</code>, <code>after/create</code> is predetermined, but you can define
what happens at each step. This pattern is called <em>inversion of control</em>, and
many developers consider it a key feature of frameworks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With *nix operating systems, you could say that in C programs the <code>main</code>
function is a kind of <code>onStart</code> callback. The OS calls <code>main</code>, and <code>main</code> tells
the OS what instructions should be run. However, the OS controls when
instructions are actually executed because the OS is in charge of scheduling.
It&#8217;s a kind of inversion of control, right? 🤔</p>

<h3 id="_communication"><a class="anchor" href="#_communication"></a>Communication</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frameworks coordinate resources, and (it&#8217;s almost a tautology to say this)
coordination requires <em>communication</em>. Communication is <em>hard</em>. Frameworks make
it easier by translating the disparate "languages" spoken by resources into one
or more common languages that are easy to understand and efficient, while also
ensuring extensibility and composability. Frameworks also do some of the work of
ensuring resilience. This usually entails:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Establishing naming and addressing conventions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing conventions for how to structure content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introducing communication brokers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handling communication failures (the database is down! that file
doesn&#8217;t exist!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One example many people are familiar with is the HTTP stack, a "language" used
to communicate between browser and server resources:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>HTTP structures content (request headers and request body as text)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TCP handles communication failures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IP handles addressing</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_conventions"><a class="anchor" href="#_conventions"></a>Conventions</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The file model is a "common language", and the OS uses device drivers to
translate between between the file model and whatever local language is spoken
by hardware devices. It has naming and addressing conventions, letting you
specify files on the filesystem using character strings separated by slashes
that it translates to an internal inode (a data structure that stores file and
directory details, like ownership and permissions). We&#8217;re so used to this that
it&#8217;s easy to forget it&#8217;s a convention; *nix systems could have been designed so
that you had to refer to files using a number or a UUID. The file descriptors I
described in the last section are also a convention.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another convention the file model introduces is to structure content as byte
streams, as opposed to bit streams, character streams, or xml documents.
However, bytes are usually too low-level, so the OS includes a suite of command
line tools that introduce the further convention of structuring bytes by
interpreting them as characters (<code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>grep</code>, and friends). More
recently, more tools have been introduced that interpret text as YAML or JSON.
The Clojure world has further tools to interpret JSON as transit. My YAML tools
can&#8217;t do jack with your JSON files, but because these formats are all expressed
in terms of lower-level formats, the lower-level tools can still work with them.
Structure affects composability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The file model&#8217;s simplicity is what allows it to be the "universal I/O model." I
mean, just imagine if all Linux processes had to communicate with XML instead of
byte streams! Hoo boy, what a crazy world that would be. Having a simple,
universal communication system makes it extremely easy for new resources to
participate without having to be directly aware of each other. It allows us to
easily compose command line tools. It allows one program to write to a log while
another reads from it. In other words, it enables loose coupling and all the
attendant benefits.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_communication_brokers"><a class="anchor" href="#_communication_brokers"></a>Communication Brokers</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Globally addressable communication brokers</em> (like the filesystem, or Kafka
queues, or databases) are essential to enabling composable systems. <em>Global</em>
means that every resource can access it. <em>Addressable</em> means that the broker
maintains identifiers for entities independently of its clients, and it&#8217;s
possible for clients to specify entities using those identifiers. <em>Communication
broker</em> means that the system&#8217;s purpose is to convey data from one resource to
another, and it has well-defined semantics: a queue has FIFO semantics, the file
system has update-in-place semantics, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If Linux had no filesystem and processes were only allowed to communicate via
pipes, it would be a nightmare. Indirect communication is more flexible than
direct communication. It supports decoupling over time, in that reads and writes
don&#8217;t have to happen synchronously. It also allows participants to drop in and
out of the communication system independently of each other. (By the way, I
can&#8217;t think of the name for this concept or some better way to express it, and
would love feedback here.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think this is the trickiest part of framework design. At the beginning of the
article I mentioned that developers might end up hacking around a framework&#8217;s
constraints, and I think the main constraint is often the absence of a
communication broker. The framework&#8217;s designers introduce new resources and
abstractions, but the only way to compose them is through direct communication,
and sometimes that direct communication is handled magically. (I seem to recall
that Rails worked with this way, with tight coupling between Controller and
Views and a lack of options for conveying Controller data to other parts of the
system). If someone wants to introduce new abstractions, they have to untangle
all the magic and hook deep into the framework&#8217;s internals, using&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or even
patching!&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;code that&#8217;s meant to be private.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I remember running into this with Rails back when MongoDB was released; the
<em>document database</em> resource was sufficiently different from the <em>relational
database resource</em> that it was pretty much impossible for MongoDB to take part
in the ActiveRecord abstraction, and it was also very difficult to introduce a
new data store abstraction that would play well with the rest of the Rails
ecosystem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a more current example, a frontend framework might identify the form as a
resource, and create a nice abstraction for it that handles things like
validation and the submission lifecycle. If the form abstraction is written in a
framework that has no communication broker (like a global state container), then
it will be very difficult to meet the common use case of using a form to filter
rows in a table because there&#8217;s no way for the code that renders table data to
access the form inputs' values. You might come up with some hack like defining
handlers for exporting the form&#8217;s state, but doing this on an ad-hoc basis
results in confusing and brittle code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By contrast, the presence of a communication broker can make life much easier.
In the Clojure world, the React frameworks <a href="https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/">re-frame</a> and <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om">om.next</a> have embraced
global state atoms, a kind of communication broker similar to the filesystem
(atoms are an in-memory storage mechanism). They also both have well defined
communication protocols. I&#8217;m not very familiar with <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> but I&#8217;ve heard tell
that it also has embraced a global, central state container.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you create a form abstraction using re-frame, it&#8217;s possible to track its
state in a global state atom. It&#8217;s further possible to establish a naming
convention for forms, making it easier for other participants to look up the
form&#8217;s data and react to it. (Sweet Tooth does this.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Communication systems are fundamental. Without them, it&#8217;s difficult to build
anything but the simplest applications. By providing communication systems,
frameworks relieve much of the cognitive burden of building a program. By
establishing communication standards, frameworks make it possible for developers
to create composable tools, tools that benefit everybody who uses that
framework. Standards make infrastructure possible, and infrastructure enables
productivity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section I focused primarily on the file model because it&#8217;s been so
successful and I think we can learn a lot from it. Other models include event
buses and message queues. I&#8217;m not going to write about these because I&#8217;m not
made of words, ok?!?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_environments"><a class="anchor" href="#_environments"></a>Environments</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frameworks are built to coordinate resources within a particular <em>environment</em>.
When we talk about desktop apps, web apps, single page apps, and mobile apps,
we&#8217;re talking about different environments. From the developer&#8217;s perspective,
environments are distinguished by the resources that are available, while from
the user&#8217;s perspective different environments entail different usage patterns
and expectations about distribution, availability, licensing, and payment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As technology advances, new resources become available (the Internet! databases!
smart phones! powerful browsers! AWS!), new environments evolve to combine those
resources, and frameworks are created to target those environments. This is why
we talk about mobile frameworks and desktop frameworks and the like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the reasons I stopped using Rails was because it was a <em>web application
framework</em>, but I wanted to build <em>single page applications</em>. At the time
(around 2012?), I was learning to use Angular and wanted to deploy applications
that used it, but it didn&#8217;t really fit with Rails&#8217;s design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And that&#8217;s OK. Some people write programs for Linux, some people write for
macOS, some people still write for Windows for some reason (just kidding! don&#8217;t
kill me!). A framework is a tool, and tools are built for a specific purpose. If
you&#8217;re trying to achieve a purpose the tool isn&#8217;t built for, use a different
tool.</p>

<h2 id="_more_benefits_of_using_frameworks"><a class="anchor" href="#_more_benefits_of_using_frameworks"></a>More Benefits of Using Frameworks</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far I&#8217;ve mostly discussed how frameworks bring benefits to the individual
developer. In this section I&#8217;ll explain how frameworks benefit communities, how
they make programming fun, and (perhaps most importantly) how they are a great
boon for beginners.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, to recap, a framework is a set of libraries that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Manages the complexity of coordinating the <em>resources</em> needed to write an
application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By providing <em>abstractions</em> for those resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And <em>systems for communicating</em> between those resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within an <em>environment</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So that programmers can focus on writing the business logic that&#8217;s specific to
their product</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This alone lifts a huge burden off of developers. In case I haven&#8217;t said it
enough, this kind of work is <em>hard</em>, and if you had to do it every time you
wanted to make an application it would be frustrating an exhausting. Actually,
let me rephrase that: I <em>have</em> had to do this work, and it <em>is</em> frustrating and
exhausting. It&#8217;s why Rails was such a godsend when I first encountered it
in 2005.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_frameworks_bring_community_benefits"><a class="anchor" href="#_frameworks_bring_community_benefits"></a>Frameworks Bring Community Benefits</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clear abstractions and communication systems allow people to share modules,
plugins, or whatever you want to call framework extensions, creating a vibrant
ecosystem of reusable components.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, Rails makes it possible for developers to identify specialized
resources and extend the framework to easily support them. One of the most
popular and powerful is [Devise](<a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">https://github.com/plataformatec/devise</a>), which
coordinates Rails resources to introduce a new user authentication resource.
Just as using Postgres is usually preferable to rolling your own database, using
Devise is usually preferable to rolling your own authentication system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you accept my assertion that an operating system is a framework, then you can
consider any program which communicates via one of the OS&#8217;s communication
systems (sockets, the file model, etc) to be an extension of the framework.
Postgres is a framework extension that adds an RDBMS resource. statsd is an
extension that adds a monitoring resource.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Would it be possible to create a Devise for Clojure? I don&#8217;t think so. Devise is
designed to be database agnostic, but because Clojure doesn&#8217;t really have a
go-to framework that anoints or introduces a go-to database abstraction, no one
can write the equivalent of Devise in such a way that it could easily target any
RDBMS. Without a framework, it&#8217;s unlikely that someone will be able to write a
full-featured authentication solution that you can reuse, and if you write one
it&#8217;s unlikely others would see much benefit if you shared it. I think it&#8217;s too
bad that Clojure is missing out on these kinds of ecosystem benefits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another subtler benefit frameworks bring is that they present a coherent story
for how developers can build applications in your language, and that makes your
language more attractive. Building an application means coordinating resources
for the environment you&#8217;re targeting (desktop, mobile, SPA, whatever). If your
language has no frameworks for a target environment, then learning or using the
language is much riskier. There&#8217;s a much higher barrier to building products:
not only does a dev have to learn the language&#8217;s syntax and paradigms, she has
to figure out how to perform the complex task of abstracting and coordinating
resources using the language&#8217;s paradigms. If your goal is to create a
mass-market product, choosing a language that doesn&#8217;t have frameworks for your
target environments is a risky choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, frameworks become a base layer that you can create tooling for. The
introduction of the filesystem made it possible for people to write tools that
easily create and manipulate files. Rails&#8217;s abstractions made it easy to
generate code for creating a new database table, along with an entire stack -
model, view, controller - for interacting with it.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_frameworks_make_development_fun"><a class="anchor" href="#_frameworks_make_development_fun"></a>Frameworks Make Development Fun</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you still think frameworks are overkill or more trouble than they&#8217;re worth,
believe me I get it. When I switched from Rails to Clojure and its "libraries
not frameworks" approach, I <em>loved</em> it. A framework felt unnecessary because all
the pieces were so simple that it was trivial for me to glue them together
myself. Also, it was just plain fun to solve a problem I was familiar with
because it helped me learn the language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well, call me a jaded millenial fart, but I don&#8217;t think that this work is fun
anymore. I want to build products, not build the infrastructure for building
products. I want a plugin that will handle the reset password process for me. I
want an admin panel that I can get working in five minutes. Frameworks handle
the kind of work that ideally only has to be done once. I don&#8217;t want to have to
do this work over and over every time I want to make something.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For me, programming is a creative endeavor. I love making dumb things and
putting them in front of people to see what will happen. Rails let me build (now
defunct) sites like phobiatopia.com, where users could share what they&#8217;re afraid
of. The site would use their IP address to come up with some geo coordinates and
use Google Maps to display a global fear map. A lot of people were afraid of
bears.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frameworks let you focus on the fun parts of building an app. They let you
release an idea, however dumb, more quickly.</p>

<h3 id="_frameworks_help_beginners"><a class="anchor" href="#_frameworks_help_beginners"></a>Frameworks Help Beginners</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frameworks help beginners by empowering them to build real, honest-to-god
running applications that they can show to their friends and even make money
with, without having to fully understand or even be aware of all the technology
they&#8217;re using. Being able to conjure up a complete creation, no matter how small
or ill-made, is the very breath of wonder and delight. (I don&#8217;t know exactly
what this means, but I like how it sounds!)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s a kind of thinking that says frameworks are bad because they allow
beginners to make stuff without having to know how it all works. ActiveRecord is
corrupting the youth, allowing them to build apps without even knowing how to
pronounce <em>SQL</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s another line of thinking that says it&#8217;s bad to try to make things easier
for beginners. It&#8217;s somehow virtuous for people to struggle or suffer for the
sake of learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hogwash. Fiddlefaddle. Poppycock. Joy beats suffering every time, and making
learning more joyful allows more people to reap the benefits of whatever tool or
product you&#8217;ve created.</p>

<p>I am a photographer. I have a professional camera, and I know how to use it.
Some of my photos require a fair amount of technical knowledge and specialized

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This isn&#8217;t something you can create with a camera phone, yet somehow I&#8217;m able to
enjoy myself and my art without complaining that point-and-shoot cameras exist
and that people like them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Novices benefit greatly from expert guidance. I don&#8217;t think you can become a
master photographer using your phone&#8217;s camera, but with the phone&#8217;s "guidance"
you can take some damn good photos and be proud of them. And if you do want to
become a master, that kind of positive feedback and sense of accomplishment will
give you the motivation to stick with it and learn the hard stuff. Frameworks
provide this guidance by creating a safe path around all the quicksand and pit
traps that you can stumble into when creating an app. Frameworks help beginners.

<h2 id="_a_clojure_framework"><a class="anchor" href="#_a_clojure_framework"></a>A Clojure Framework</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frameworks are all about managing the complexity of coordinating resources.
Well, guess what: Managing Complexity is Clojure&#8217;s middle name. Clojure
"Managing Complexity" McCarthy-Lisp. Personally, I want a single-page app (SPA)
framework, and there are many aspects of Clojure&#8217;s design and philosophy that I
think will make it possible to create one that seriously kicks ass. I&#8217;ll give
just a few examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, consider how Linux tools like <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> are text-oriented.
Developers can add additional structure to text by formatting it as JSON or
YAML, and those text-processing tools can still work the structured text.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the same way, Clojure&#8217;s emphasis on simple data structures means that we can
create specialized structures to represent forms and ajax request, and tools to
process those structures. If we define those structures in terms of maps and
vectors, though, we&#8217;ll still be able to use a vast ecosystem of functions for
working with those simpler structures. In other words, creating specialized
structures does not preclude us from using the tools built for simpler
structures, and this isn&#8217;t the case for many other languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, Clojure&#8217;s abstraction mechanisms (protocols and multimethods) are
extremely flexible, making it easy for us to implement abstractions for new
resources as they become available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Third, <em>you can use the same language for the frontend and backend!!!</em> Not only
that, Transit allows the two to effortlessly communicate. This eliminates an
entire class of coordination problems that frameworks in other languages have to
contend with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my opinion, the Clojurian stance that frameworks are more trouble than
they&#8217;re worth is completely backwards: Clojure gives us the foundation to build
a completely kick-ass framework! One that&#8217;s simple <em>and</em> easy. One can dream,
right?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My ambition in building a SPA framework is to empower current and future Clojure
devs to get our ideas into production <em>fast</em>. I want us to be able to spend more
time on the hard stuff, the fun stuff, the interesting stuff. And I want us to
be able to easily ship with confidence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The framework I&#8217;m building is built on top of some truly amazing libraries,
primarily Integrant, re-frame, and Liberator. Integrant introduces a <em>component</em>
abstraction and handles the start/stop lifecycle of an application. re-frame
provides a filesystem and communication broker for the frontend. Liberator
introduces a standard model for handling HTTP requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If my framework is useful at all it&#8217;s because the creators of those tools have
done all the heavy lifting. My framework introduces more resources and
abstractions specific to creating single-page apps. For example, it creates an
abstraction for wrapping AJAX requests so that you can easily display activity
indicators when a request is active. It creates a form abstraction that handles
all the plumbing of handling input changes and dispatching form submission, as
well the entire form lifecycle of <em>fresh</em>, <em>dirty</em>, <em>submitted</em>, <em>invalid</em>,
<em>succeeded</em>, etc. It imposes some conventions for organizing data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;d like to see a production app that uses the framework, however, I invite
you to check out [Grateful Place](<a href="https://gratefulplace.com">https://gratefulplace.com</a>), a community site
for people who want to support each other in growing resilience, peace, and joy
by practicing compassion, gratitude, generosity, and other positive values. By

know that you support them and share their values.</p>

<p>Please click around and look at the snazzy loading animations. And if you feel
so moved, please do join! I <em>love</em> getting to interact with people in that
context of mutual support for shared values. One of the only things I care about
more than Clojure is helping people develop the tools to navigate this crazy-ass
world :D</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the mean time, I&#8217;ll keep working on getting this framework ready for public
consumption. Expect another blawg article sharing some details on how Grateful
Place is implemented. Then, eventually, hopefully, an actual announcement for
the framework itself :)</p>
