= Sweet Tooth =
Daniel Higginbotham


Sweet Tooth is a Clojure and ClojureScript Single Page App (SPA) framework. My
dream for Sweet Tooth is to make it easier, faster, and funner for developers
like you to get your ideas into production. I want to provide a modular,
extensible, composable foundation that lets you *focus on the work that thrills
you* -- without worrying that the framework will make your life harder months or
years from now. I want Clojure beginners to be able to make something freakin'
badass right at the start of their journey.

If that sounds interesting to you, I hope you'll give the framework a try. The
xref:quickstart.adoc[Quickstart] will take you through the steps to create your
own Sweet Tooth project. The xref:todo-example:ROOT:index.adoc[To-Do Example
Walkthrough] is a depth-first exploration of the framework using a simple
working app. The rest of this page provides an overview of the project.

This documentation is a work in progress ðŸ™‚. It doesn't cover every function,
every re-frame event handler, every nook and cranny. It does cover the major
ideas, and many facets of the framework are explained in great detail. Though I
want to one day write a guide for complete beginners, the docs are currently
written for devs with some Clojure experience.

I love making web apps; it's a form of creative expression for me. Clojure is
the best medium I've found so far for this kind of creativity. I hope this
little project makes it possible for more people to experience the same joy and
excitement of bringing their ideas to life.

== Easier, Faster, Funner ==
Sweet Tooth (ST) handles common SPA concerns like form workflows, routing and
navigation, and HTTP request management. These use cases are not particular to
the app you're trying to build, but as a Clojurian you've likely had to figure
them out for yourself when building an SPA. In the same way that you shouldn't
have to write your own filesystem when making a desktop app, you shouldn't have
to write your own form handling system to launch your idea.


== Modularity, Extensibility, Composability ==
I've tried to write Sweet Tooth so that using it doesn't lock you in the way
some frameworks do. ST is built as layers on top of popular and proven libraries
like re-frame, duct, integrant, liberator, ring, and reitit, and you can always
use those libraries directly if you need to. For example, ST's form system
introduces a default re-frame handler for successful form submissions, but it's
ultimately just re-frame and you can use whatever handler you want. Or, you can
elect not to use Sweet Tooth forms at all, but still use the frontend navigation
system for handling URL changes.

Eventually, I'd like to make it dramatically easier for beginners to make cool
stuff and show it to the world. There's still much work to be done to get there,
both in tooling and documentation.

If it turns out that what I've put together here is useful, it might even be
possible for us to begin creating an ecosystem of SPA libraries for handling
common concerns like email, payments, and more. Wouldn't that be amazing? I
think it would be.

What is this project not made for? Sweet Tooth is not for creating
server-rendered apps. It hasn't been used for high-traffic projects, so it's
currently not for that, either. It has no support for GraphQL, though I think
it'd be possible to add that. It's not intended for drawing applications
(think fuzzy:intended for form-oriented applications rather than drawing applications - it's meant to build apps like [Whimsical]), but who knows, maybe that would work out ok?

These docs aren't complete, but I hope that what I've put together so far will
spark your curiosity and you'll give these tools a try. I've found them to be
very fun to use, and they've helped me -- a solo developer -- build and maintain
some real, honest-to-god production sites that even make a little money. I hope
I've made something useful to the broader Clojure community here. Time will
tell.
